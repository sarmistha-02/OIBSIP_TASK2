            <h2>Early Career:1940s and 1950s</h2>
            <p>Legendary playback singer Lata Mangeshkar was noted for her distinctive voice and vocal range that
                extended over more than three octaves. She was born on 28 September 1929 in Indore, India. She was the
                eldest of five siblings. Her father was Pandit Deenanath Mangeshkar and her mother was Shevanti. She was
                introduced to music at an early age. At the age of 13, she recorded her first song "Naachu Yaa Gade,
                Khelu Saari Mani Haus Bhaari" for Vasant Joglekar’s Marathi film Kiti Hasaal. She established herself as
                a playback singer in the Hindi film industry of the 1940s. She moved to Mumbai in 1945. She started
                taking lessons from Ustad Aman Ali Khan of Bhindibazaar Gharana in Hindustani classical music. For the
                movie Aap Ki Seva Mein (1946), she sang the song "Paa Lagoon Kar Jori" which was composed by Datta
                Davjekar. She recorded the hit “Uthaye ja unke sitam” in Andaz (1949), and her destiny was sealed. From
                this point, she gave her musical voice to every major leading lady, representing every generation of
                Hindi cinema from Nargis and Waheeda Rehman to Madhuri Dixit and Preity Zinta. Her singing contributed a
                great deal to the commercial films like Mahal (1949), Barsaat (1949), Meena Bazaar (1950), Aadhi Raat
                (1950), Chhoti Bhabhi (1950), Afsana (1951), Aansoo (1953), and Adl-e-Jehangir (1955). She also sang
                various Raag-based songs for Naushad in films like Deedar (1951), Baiju Bawra (1952), Amar (1954), Uran
                Khatola (1955), and Mother India (1957). Her first song for the composer Naushad was Ae Chorre Ki Jaat
                Badi Bewafa, a duet with G. M. Durrani. The duo, Shankar–Jaikishan, chose Lata for Barsaat (1949), Aah
                (1953), Shree 420 (1955), and Chori Chori (1956).</p>
